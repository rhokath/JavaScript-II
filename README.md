# JavaScript - II

With some basic JavaScript principles in hand, we can now expand our skills out even further by exploring callback functions, array methods, and closure.  Finish each task in order as the concepts build on one another.

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE
* [ ] To test your `console.log()` statements, open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  


## Task 2: Callbacks

This task focuses on getting practice with callback functions by giving you an array of values and instructions on what to do with that array.

* [ ] Review the contents of the [callbacks.js](assignments/callbacks.js) file.  Notice you are given an array at the top of the page.  Use that array to aid you with your functions.

* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Task 3: Array Methods

Use `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to loop over an array with 50 objects in it. The [array-methods.js](assignments/array-methods.js) file contains several challenges built around a fundraising 5K fun run event.

* [ ] Review the contents of the [array-methods.js](assignments/array-methods.js) file.  

* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

* [ ] Notice the last three problems are up to you to create and solve.  This is an awesome opportunity for you to push your critical thinking about array methods, have fun with it.

## Task 4: Closures

We have learned that closures allow us to access values in scope that have already been invoked (lexical scope).  

**Hint: Utilize debugger statements in your code in combination with your developer tools to easily identify closure values.**

* [ ] Review the contents of the [closure.js](assignments/closure.js) file.  
* [ ] Complete the problems provided to you but skip over stretch problems until you are complete with every other JS file first.

## Stretch Goals

* [ ] Go back through the stretch problems that you skipped over and complete as many as you can.
* [ ] Look up what an IIFE is in JavaScript and experiment with them
